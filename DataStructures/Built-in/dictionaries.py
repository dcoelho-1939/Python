# Dictionaries are a collection of key/value pairs.
# The keys hold the values, which means, to access any 
# value we need to use the keys.

example = {
    "name": "Davi",
    "age": 24,
    "nationality": "Brazilian"
}

# Dictionaries are ordered(after Python 3.6) and do not 
# allow for duplicates. They are also changeable.
