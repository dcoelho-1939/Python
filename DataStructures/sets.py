# Sets are also a way of storing multiple values within a variable.
# The difference is that with sets, we can't have duplicates.
# Sets also do not have any sort of ordering. Which means the order 
# of a set can change randomly everytime you execute the program.

# Sets are also unchangeable:
example = {"Davi", "Nayara", "Liara"}
# example[0] = "David" -> this line of code will generate an error
